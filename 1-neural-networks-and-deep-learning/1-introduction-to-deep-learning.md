## what is an artificial neural network (ann)?

the simplest possible ann is a single regression algorithm, so an ann is composed of multiple regression algorithms composed together in layers

## types of neural networks

standard neural network (used for structured data)
convolutional neural network (used for unstructured data)
recurrent neural network (used for time series data)
